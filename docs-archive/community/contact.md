Hi üëã

Thank you for wanting to contact us ‚ù§Ô∏è.

This page outlines the various ways you can touch base.

### SPIFFE Slack Workspace

The [**SPIFFE** Slack Workspace](https://slack.spiffe.io/) if one of the best 
ways to get in touch with the community, ask questions and get help.

If you have a question, a feature request, or a bug report, it'll be great
if you could initiate a discussion on [**Slack**](https://slack.spiffe.io/). 

### Email

You can also reach out to us on via email, sending an email to 
[team@spike.ist](mailto:team@spike.ist).

## GitHub Issues

Additionally, you can [create a **GitHub** 
issue](https://github.com/spiffe/spike/issues/new); however, we recommend
using the [SPIFFE **Slack**](https://slack.spiffe.io), or 
[sending an email to the team](mailto:team@spike.ist) to initiate a discussion 
before creating an issue.
