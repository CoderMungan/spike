      Use Case: Each SPIKE Keeper in its own trust domain.
      (we can also create a demo once this feature is established)

      Details:

      The current design assumes that all keepers are in the same trust boundary
      (which defaults to spike.ist)
      that can make sense for a single-cluster deployment
      (each keeper can be tainted to deploy itself on a distinct node for
      redundancy)
      however; a keeper's SPIFFE ID does not have to have a single trust root.
      each SPIKE keeper can (in theory) live in a separate cluster, in its own
      trust boundary, depicted by a different trust root.

      If that's the case the below function will not be valid

      func IsKeeper(id string) bool {
      return id == spiffeid.SpikeKeeper()
      }

      Instead of this the validation should be done against SPIKE_NEXUS_KEEPER_PEERS
      and the env var should also contain the trust root of each keeper.

      Similarly, the function cannot check the trust root.
      it may however verify the part of spiffeID "after" the trust root.

      // I should be a SPIKE Keeper.
      if !auth.IsKeeper(selfSpiffeid) {
      log.FatalF("Authenticate: SPIFFE ID %s is not valid.\n", selfSpiffeid)
      }

      So for the `main` function of SPIKE Keeper we'll need a more relaxed
      version of IsKeeper.
      and the IsKeeper in SPIKE Nexus will validate looking at the env
      config.

      which also means, SPIKE Keeper can require SPIKE_TRUST_ROOT along
      with SPIKE_KEEPER_TLS_PORT to start. at start-keeper-1.sh

      Go binaries do not have stripped symbols by default. By default,
      Go includes symbols for debugging, function names, and even full DWARF
      debugging information unless explicitly removed. This can make Go binaries
      quite large.

      How to Strip Symbols
      If you want to strip symbols from a Go binary to reduce its size, you can use:

      Using strip (Linux/macOS)
      strip mybinary
      This removes debugging symbols and symbol tables.
      Building with ldflags
      go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o mybinary
      -s: Omits the symbol table.
      -w: Omits DWARF debugging information.
      Using upx for Compression You can further reduce the binary size with:
      upx --best mybinary
      Checking Symbols
      You can check if a binary has symbols using:

      nm mybinary  # On Linux/macOS
      objdump -t mybinary  # Alternative

      if a keeper crashes it has to wait for the next nexus cycle which is

      if threshold number of keepers do not have the shard too, then there is

      Not quite. Because later, we can have ways to seed keepers, maybe through
      other nexuses, maybe via cloning from a backup keeper, maybe using a
      secure keeper API (i.e. imitating nexus)

      It's better, and simpler to keep the polling always running.

      This is OpenBao's production deployment checlist; check of if any of
      those also applies for SPIKE, of if we need different/additional items
      for SPIKE.

      From the context, OpenBao can be swapped with SPIKE Nexus, I think:

      End-to-End TLS. OpenBao should always be used with TLS in production. If
      intermediate load balancers or reverse proxies are used to front OpenBao,
      they should not terminate TLS. This way traffic is always encrypted in
      transit to OpenBao and minimizes risks introduced by intermediate layers.

      Single Tenancy. OpenBao should be the only main process running on a
      machine. This reduces the risk that another process running on the same
      machine is compromised and can interact with OpenBao. This can be
      accomplished by using OpenBao Helm's affinity configurable.

      Enable Auditing. OpenBao supports several auditing backends. Enabling
      auditing provides a history of all operations performed by OpenBao and
      provides a forensics trail in the case of misuse or compromise. Audit logs
      securely hash any sensitive data, but access should still be restricted to
      prevent any unintended disclosures. OpenBao Helm includes a configurable
      auditStorage option that provisions a persistent volume to store audit
      logs.

      Immutable Upgrades. OpenBao relies on an external storage backend for
      persistence, and this decoupling allows the servers running OpenBao to be
      managed immutably. When upgrading to new versions, new servers with the
      upgraded version of OpenBao are brought online. They are attached to the
      same shared storage backend and unsealed. Then the old servers are
      destroyed. This reduces the need for remote access and upgrade
      orchestration which may introduce security gaps. See the upgrade section
      for instructions on upgrading OpenBao on Kubernetes.

      Upgrade Frequently. OpenBao is actively developed, and updating frequently
      is important to incorporate security fixes and any changes in default
      settings such as key lengths or cipher suites. Subscribe to the OpenBao
      mailing list and GitHub CHANGELOG for updates.

      Restrict Storage Access. OpenBao encrypts all data at rest, regardless of
      which storage backend is used. Although the data is encrypted, an attacker
      with arbitrary control can cause data corruption or loss by modifying or
      deleting keys. Access to the storage backend should be restricted to only
      OpenBao to avoid unauthorized access or operations.

      a mode that enables the admin to load shares to keepers.
      this will be essentially using the keeper REST API and acting as
      SPIKE Pilot with a recover svid.
      The benefit would be; we can have a dedicated recover and restore binaries
      without having to expose the pilot binary.
      Or we can update the keepers, even if we don't have access to SPIKE Nexus
      or SPIKE Nexus is down.
      maybe by using a "seeder" SPIFFE ID.
      but I'm also not sure if it's worth it.
      it would mean more APIs to secure; it would also mean keeping spike
      keepers more intelligent (instead of keeping them dumb)

      SPIKE CSI Driver

      the CSI Secrets Store driver enables users to create
      `SecretProviderClass` objects. These objects define which secret
      provider
      to use and what secrets to retrieve. When pods requesting CSI
      volumes are
      made, the CSI Secrets Store driver sends the request to the OpenBao
      CSI
      provider if the provider is `vault`. The CSI provider then uses the
      specified `SecretProviderClass` and the pod’s service account to
      retrieve
      the secrets from OpenBao and mount them into the pod’s CSI volume.
      Note
      that the secret is retrieved from SPIKE Nexus and populated to the
      CSI
      secrets store volume during the `ContainerCreation` phase.
      Therefore, pods
      are blocked from starting until the secrets are read from SPIKE and
      written to the volume.

      # secret/super-secret. this takes precedence.
      path "secret/super-secret" {

      }

      # Policies can also specify allowed, disallowed, and required
      parameters. here

      capabilities = ["create"]
      allowed_parameters = {
      "foo" = []

      }

      but also, instead of going deep down into the policy rabbit hole,
      maybe
      it's better to rely on well-established policy engines like OPA.

      A rego-based evaluation will give allow/deny decisions, which SPIKE
      Nexus
      can then honor.

      Think about pros/cons of each approach. -- SPIKE can have a
      good-enough
      default policy engine, and for more sophisticated functionality we
      can
      leverage OPA.

      key rotation

      NIST rotation guidance

      Periodic rotation of the encryption keys is recommended, even in the
      absence of compromise. Due to the nature of the AES-256-GCM
      encryption
      used, keys should be rotated before approximately 232
      encryptions have been performed, following the guidelines of NIST
      publication 800-38D.

      SPIKE will automatically rotate the backend encryption key prior to
      reaching
      232 encryption operations by default.

      also support manual key rotation

      ability to clone a keeper cluster to another standby keeper cluster
      (for redundancy).
      this way, if the set of keepers become not operational, we can

      adding a timeout or circuit breaker to the infinite loop in BootstrapBackingStoreWithNewRootKey, I was suggesting a way to prevent the function from running indefinitely if something goes wrong with keeper initialization.
      The current implementation uses:
      for {
      // Ensure to get a success response from ALL keepers eventually.
      exit := iterateKeepersToBootstrap(
      keepers, rootShares, successfulKeepers, source,
      )
      if exit {
      return
      }

      log.Log().Info(fName, "msg", "Waiting for keepers to initialize")
      // TODO: make the time configurable.
      time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
      }
      This loop will continue forever until all keepers are successfully initialized. While this makes sense for normal operation, there are scenarios where this could become problematic:

      If one or more keepers are permanently unavailable or unreachable
      If there's a persistent network issue preventing communication
      If there's a configuration issue that makes successful initialization impossible

      A potential improvement would be to add:
      maxAttempts := env.GetMaxBootstrapAttempts() // Could be configurable
      attempts := 0

      ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), env.GetBootstrapTimeout())
      defer cancel()

      for {
      select {
      case lt-ctx.Done():
      log.Log().Warn(fName, "msg", "Bootstrap timed out after waiting threshold")
      // Implement fallback strategy or escalate the issue
      return
      default:
      attempts++
      if maxAttempts > 0 ++ attempts > maxAttempts {
      log.Log().Warn(fName, "msg", "Exceeded maximum bootstrap attempts")
      // Implement fallback strategy or escalate the issue
      return
      }

      exit := iterateKeepersToBootstrap(
      keepers, rootShares, successfulKeepers, source,
      )
      if exit {
      return
      }

      log.Log().Info(fName, "msg", "Waiting for keepers to initialize",
      "attempt", attempts, "maxAttempts", maxAttempts)
      time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
      }
      }
      This approach provides:

      A maximum number of attempts (configurable)
      A total timeout for the entire operation (configurable)
      Better observability of progress through attempt counting

      In highly reliable systems, you might want the bootstrap to keep trying forever, but even then, it's valuable to have observability into how long it's been trying and an option to break the loop if needed.

      JSON Security:

      Marshaling/unmarshaling sensitive data with standard JSON functions can leave traces in memory
      Consider if a more secure serialization approach is needed for sensitive data

      Regarding more secure JSON serialization approaches for sensitive data, here are several strategies you could consider:

      Custom Secure Marshaler/Unmarshaler:

      Implement custom JSON marshal/unmarshal methods that use secure memory practices
      Include zero-out operations immediately after the data is no longer needed
      Use fixed-size arrays rather than slices to avoid heap allocations


      Buffer Pooling with Zeroing:

      Create a pool of fixed-size buffers for serialization operations
      Zero out buffers before returning them to the pool
      This minimizes allocations and ensures cleanup


      Memory-Safe Serialization Libraries:

      Look into security-focused serialization libraries that handle memory better than standard encoding/json
      Some cryptographic libraries include serialization functions designed for sensitive data


      Encrypted Serialization:

      Serialize to an encrypted format directly
      The data stays encrypted in memory except during actual use


      Use of Go's io.Writer Interface:

      Marshal directly to a pre-allocated buffer using json.Encoder
      This gives more control over the underlying memory


      Manual Field-by-Field Handling:

      For extremely sensitive structures, avoid automatic JSON marshaling entirely
      json marshaling and unmarshaling can leave traces in memory.

      Instead, construct the JSON manually field by field, zeroing intermediate
      buffers



      A practical implementation might look like:
      func secureJSONMarshal(v interface{}) ([]byte, error) {
      // Pre-allocate buffer of reasonable size to avoid resizing
      buffer := make([]byte, 0, 1024)

      // Use buffer as writer to avoid intermediate string allocations
      b := bytes.NewBuffer(buffer)
      encoder := json.NewEncoder(b)

      // Disable HTML escaping to reduce copying
      encoder.SetEscapeHTML(false)

      err := encoder.Encode(v)
      if err != nil {
      return nil, err
      }

      // Get result as byte slice
      result := b.Bytes()

      // Create a copy that we'll return
      finalResult := make([]byte, len(result))
      copy(finalResult, result)

      // Zero out the original buffer
      for i := range result {
      result[i] = 0
      }

      return finalResult, nil
      }
      For unmarshaling, we could use a similar approach with a pre-allocated
      structure and careful buffer management.

      Note: this is non-trivial, but doable.

      Periodic rotation of the encryption keys is recommended, even in the
      absence of compromise. Due to the nature of the AES-256-GCM
      encryption
      used, keys should be rotated before approximately 232 encryptions
      have
      been performed, following the guidelines of NIST publication
      800-38D.

      This can be achieved by having a separate encryption key protected
      by
      the root key and rotating the encryption key, and maybe maintaining
      a

      the backing store is considered untrusted and it stores
      encrypted information
      todo: if it's "really" untrusted then maybe it's better to encrypt
      everything

      maybe ha mode

      HA Mode in OpenBao: In HA mode, OpenBao operates with one active server
      and multiple standby servers. The active server processes all requests,
      while standby servers redirect requests to the active instance. If the
      active server fails, one of the standby servers takes over as the new
      active instance. This mechanism relies on PostgreSQL's ability to manage
      locks and ensure consistency across nodes35.
      Limitations:
      The PostgreSQL backend for OpenBao is community-supported and considered
      in an early preview stage, meaning it may have breaking changes or limited
      testing in production environments2.
      While PostgreSQL supports replication and failover mechanisms for its own
      HA, these features operate independently of OpenBao's HA mode. Proper
      configuration and monitoring of the PostgreSQL cluster are essential to
      ensure database-level resilience

      --

      based on the following, maybe move SQLite "create table" ddls to a
      separate file.
      Still a "tool" or a "job" can do that out-of-band.

      update: for SQLite it does not matter as SQLite does not have a
      concept
      of RBAC; creating a db is equivalent to creating a file.
      For other databases, it can be considered, so maybe write an ADR for
      that.

      ADR:

      It's generally considered better security practice to create the
      schema
      out-of-band (separate from the application) for several reasons:

      Principle of Least Privilege:

      The application should only have the permissions it needs for
      runtime
      (INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, etc.)
      Schema modification rights (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, etc.) are not
      needed during normal operation
      This limits potential damage if the application is compromised


      Change Management:

      Database schema changes can be managed through proper migration
      tools
      Changes can be reviewed, versioned, and rolled back if needed
      Prevents accidental schema modifications during application restarts


      Environment Consistency:

      Ensures all environments (dev, staging, prod) have identical schemas
      Reduces risk of schema drift between environments
      Makes it easier to track schema changes in version control

    <issue kind="idea">
      ideation:

      state is expensive to maintain.
      thats one of the reasons cloud services try and decouple/minimize
      state
      as such, the fewest number of state stores I can get away with
      reasonably the better
      and the state stores that are light weight are much better then the
      state stores that are heavy weight.
      there is no more heavyyweight state store than a network attached
      sql sever.


      It makes sense to argue that "we already have paid the expensive
      cost of a postgresql,
      so we just want to use that rather then add anything else". That,
      can make sense.

      but for those of us not carrying a postgresql already, its better
      not to have to have one added.

      so... it makes sense to make the backing store "plugin-based"

      3 backends that people might want for different reasons:
      * s3 - be stateless for your own admin needs, state managed by
      someone else
      * k8s crds - you are already maintaining an etcd cluster. Might as
      well reuse it
      * postgresql - you maintain a postgresql and want to reuse that

      the first two initially feel different then postgresql code wise...
      they are document stores.
      But posgres is pretty much json-compatible; besides SPIKE does not
      have a complicated ata model.
      So, we can find a common ground and treat all databases that are
      plugged-in as forms of document stores.

      It could keep the code to talk to the db to a real minimum.

      The files should be encrypted by the spike key, so should be fine
      just putting in a k8s crd or something without a second layer of
      encryption
      that can be a big selling point. already have a small k8s cluster?
      just add this component and now you have a secret store too. no
      hassle.
    </issue>
    <issue kind="idea">
      use custom resources as backing store;
      since everything is encrypted and not many people want a fast
      secrets creation throughtput it woudl be useful.
      because then you can do `helm install spiffe/spire` and use it
      without any state tracking.
