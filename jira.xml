<purpose>
Our goal is to have a minimally delightful product.
Strive not to add features just for the sake of adding features.
If there are half-complete features, missing tests, and the like, they should
be completed before adding more features.

	SPIKE Nexus Root Key Provisioning and Recovery
	sequence diagram issue: create root key if not exist;
	also check Keep before creating the key.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	if `spike init` is called while nexus is not ready; spike thinks it's
	initialized and will not re-init.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	The website needs a footer.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	mode for keeperless operation (fore development maybe).
	</issue>
</immediate-backlog>
<after-demo>
	<issue>
	implement exponential retries.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	make sure that everything sanitizable are properly sanitized.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Algorithm change in `spike get` (instead of verifying the admin token,
	use short-lived token you get from SPIKE Nexus)
	</issue>
	<issue>
	`const urlSecretPut = "https://localhost:8553/v1/secrets"` ->
	these should be configurable.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	state.SetAdminToken(adminToken) // This is temporary, for demo. Update it based on new sequence diagrams.
	adminToken := req.Data // admin token will be auto created, we just need a strong password, and sanitize that password
	</issue>
	<bug>
	- BUG: Re-initing after failed initialization returns success.
	aegis@aegis:~/Desktop/WORKSPACE/spike$ spike init
	Failed to save admin token:
	failed to save token to nexus
	Post "https://localhost:8553/v1/init": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8553: connect: connection refused.
	post: Problem connecting to peer
	aegis@aegis:~/Desktop/WORKSPACE/spike$ spike init
	SPIKE is already initialized.
	Nothing to do.

	Do some static analysis.

	<issue>
	create community and contact pages.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Add correlation id to logs where there is context.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	for a proper audit these paths should return an error and the auditor should
	log unsuccessful cases

	<issue>
	Create secret metadata API.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Maybe move the kv store, and the logger to a `pkg` folder instead of
	`internal` because they are reusable as they are in isolation.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Have a way to clean up outdated session tokens to avoid memory leaks.

	Secret metadata API.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	- SPIKE Nexus Sanity Tests
		- Ensure SPIKE Nexus caches the root key in memory.
		- Ensure SPIKE Nexus reads from SPIKE keep if it does not have the root key.
		- Ensure SPIKE Nexus saves the encrypted root key to the database.
		- Ensure SPIKE Nexus caches the user's session key.
		- Ensure SPIKE Nexus removes outdated session keys.
		- Ensure SPIKE Nexus does not re-init (without manual intervention) after
		being initialized.
		- Ensure SPIKE Nexus adheres to the bootstrapping sequence diagram.
		- Ensure SPIKE Nexus backs up the admin token by encrypting it with the root
		key and storing in the database.
		- Ensure SPIKE Nexus stores the initialization tombstone in the database.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	- SPIKE Pilot Sanity Tests
		- Ensure SPIKE Pilot denies any operation if SPIKE Nexus is not initialized.
		- Ensure SPIKE Pilot can warn if SPIKE Nexus is unreachable
		- Ensure SPIKE Pilot does not indefinitely hang up if SPIRE is not there.
		- Ensure SPIKE Pilot can get and set a secret.
		- Ensure SPIKE Pilot can do a force reset.
		- Ensure SPIKE Pilot can recover the root password.
		- Ensure that after `spike init` you have a password-encrypted root key in the db.
		- Ensure that you can recover the password-encrypted root key.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	- SPIKE Keep Sanity Tests
		- Ensure that the root key is stored in SPIKE Keep's memory.
		- Ensure that SPIKE Keep can return the root key back to SPIKE Nexus.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Consider a health check / heartbeat between Nexus and Keeper.
	This can be more frequent than the root key sync interval.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Unit tests and coverage reports.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Integration tests.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Test automation.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Assigning secrets to SPIFFE IDs or SPIFFE ID prefixes.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	RW policies for workloads baesd on path and SPIFFE IDs.
	(or maybe experiment with S3 policies before reinventing a policy engine)
	</issue>

<to-plan>
	<issue>
	S3 (or compatible) backing store

<future>
	<issue>
	- Security Measures (SPIKE Nexus)
		- Encrypting the root key with admin password is good
		Consider adding salt to the password encryption
		- Maybe add a key rotation mechanism for the future
	</issue>
	<issue>
	- Error Handling
		- Good use of exponential retries
		- Consider adding specific error types/codes for different failure scenarios
		- Might want to add cleanup steps for partial initialization failures
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Ability to stream logs and audit trails outside of std out.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Audit logs should write to a separate location.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Create a dedicated OIDC resource server (that acts like Pilot but exposes a
	restful API for things like CI/CD integration.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	HSM integration (i.e. root key is managed/provided by an HSM, and the key
	ever leaves the trust boundary of the HSM.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	double-encryption of nexus-keeper comms (in case mTLS gets compromised, or
	SPIRE is configured to use an upstream authority that is compromised, this
	will provide end-to-end encryption and an additional layer of security over
	the existing PKI)
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Ability to rotate the root key (automatic via Nexus).
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Ability to rotate the admin token (manual).
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Admin tokens can expire.
	</issue>
	<issue>
	Encourage to create users instead of relying on the system user.
	</issue>
