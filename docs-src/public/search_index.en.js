The secrets\nare encrypted and backed up to a secondary backup storage; however, the primary\nsource of truth is the in-memory store.\nThis is an efficient mechanism to store application secrets (e.g.,\nAPI keys, certificates, even relatively beefy Kubeconfig files).\nHowever, we need to maintain certain requirements for SPIKE to be a\nproduction-grade secure, reliable, and robust secrets store:\nOur requirements include:\n\nHigh-Performance Access: Secrets should be rapidly retrievable with\nminimal latency.\nRobust Backup and Recovery: The system should persist data safely and\nrecover quickly from crashes.\nSecurity: Restrict access to secrets via path-based policies and protect\ndata at rest via encryption.\nAuditability: Record all read/write operations for compliance and\nmonitoring.\nScalability: The system should handle up to hundreds of thousands of\nsecrets.\nHigh Availability: Provide read replicas for scaling reads and failover\nstrategies.\n\nWe considered disk-only, disk-first, cloud-storage-only\n(like AWS S3) and cloud-storage-first solutions and decided a memory-first\nsecrets store with a reliable back-up mechanism is the best fit for SPIKE.\nDecision\nSPIKE will be an in-memory secrets store with the following characteristics:\n\nIn-Memory Data: The primary data store resides in RAM, offering\nnear-instant reads and writes.\nPeriodic Backup: An encrypted backing store (SQLite, Postgres DB, or an\nS3-compatible interface) will serve as a backup. The system uses exponential\nretries to ensure data persistence.\nHardened Container: The service is recommended to run in a hardened\ncontainer or sandbox with minimal OS surface area, reducing the likelihood of\nroot compromise.\nPath-Based Access Controls: Secrets are organized hierarchically\n(for, e.g., /secrets/acme/*). Only specific roles/tokens can access their\nrespective paths.\nReplication: A primary read-write store with read-only replicas. These\nreplicas can be promoted or re-hydrated if the primary fails.\nAuditing: All secret operations (reads, writes, deletes) are logged to\nan audit trail for compliance and investigation.\n\nRationale\n\nPerformance: In-memory data reduces latency compared to purely\ndisk-backed solutions.\nBackup Safety: The secondary backup (encrypted at rest) mitigates memory\nvolatility by allowing the system to recover from unexpected crashes or\nrestarts.\nSecurity:\n\nHardened Container: Minimizes OS-level attack surface.\nEncryption at Rest: Protects offline backups if the disk is compromised.\nPath-Based Policies: Enforces the principle of least privilege.\nAuditing: Aids in compliance and detection of unauthorized access.\nScalability: Storing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of secrets\nin memory is feasible with proper resource planning.\n\n\n\nConsequences\nPositive Outcomes\n\nPerformance Gain: Ultra-fast secrets retrieval for latency-sensitive\napplications.\nBackup Resilience: Encrypted disk backups reduce permanent data loss\nif the container restarts.\nFine-Grained Control*: Path-based policies and an internal auditing\nmechanism meet security and compliance needs.\n\nTrade-Offs and Risks\nIn contrast to our decision, here are some benefits of using a database (or a\nremote object storage) as the single source of truth:\n\nSecurity and Persistence: Using an encrypted database as the source of truth\nensures that secrets are securely stored and persist across system restarts\nor crashes. Though with frequent forced writes, the risk of data loss is\nminimized and can further be mitigated by using mechanisms like message queues.\nScalability: Databases can handle growth more effectively, allowing\nthe system to accommodate increasing amounts of secrets without a significant\nredesign. Again, this is a non-issue because if you have to store millions of\nsecrets, then you need to review your architecture anyway. In an ideal world,\nthe only secret an app needs are PKI certificates (like SVIDs) as they can\nuniquely identify the app.\nSimplicity: A single source of truth simplifies the architecture, making\nthe system easier to develop, and maintain. To counter this, SPIKE Nexus’\ncurrent architecture is simple enough to maintain and develop. We have\nabstracted exponential backoff and retry mechanisms to the storage layer, and\nonce we have adequate abstractions, the maintainability of the system will\nbe equivalent to a database-as-the-single-source-of-truth system. Besides,\nat the cost of simplicity, we lose performance and will have to implement\nadditional caching mechanisms to mitigate latency, which will add complexity\nand result in an equally complex system. There is no free lunch.\n\nHere are some other liabilities of a memory-first secrets store:\n\nCrash Consistency: Potential for a small window of data loss if the system\ncrashes just before backup.\n\nMitigation: frequent or near-synchronous write-through.\n\n\nFailover Complexity: Replication and promotion logic must be robustly\nimplemented to handle node failures seamlessly.\nMemory as an Additional Attack Surface:\n\nWhile ephemeral in-memory storage can mitigate certain disk-theft scenarios,\nmemory itself can be inspected if an attacker gains OS-level access.\nThat’s why hardening the container and ensuring proper access controls are\ncrucial. SPIKE assume the machine as the trusted boundary. So, if the\nmachine is compromised, the secrets are considered compromised as well.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKubernetes Secrets Management Best Practices\nHashiCorp Vault High-Availability Reference\nSQLite Encryption Extension Documentation\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/architecture/adrs/adr-0016/","title":"ADR-0016: ADR-0015: Memory-First Secrets Store"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/architecture/adrs/adr-0017/":{"body":"\nADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence for SPIKE Secrets Store\n\nStatus: accepted\nDate: 2025-01-25\nTags: Security, Persistence, Database, Backing-Store, Performance\n\nContext\nSPIKE is a secrets store that can use a SQLite backing store (among other\nbacking store options) to persist secrets. However, the source of truth for\nthe secrets is held in memory. SQLite is primarily used as a backup to rehydrate\nsecrets in case the secrets store crashes or needs to be recovered.\nPersistence operations were initially designed to be asynchronous, using methods\nlike AsyncSaveSecret(), to minimize blocking and improve performance. However,\nthis design has introduced unnecessary complexity, race conditions, and edge\ncases, with no significant benefit to the overall system. SQLite, being fast and\nlightweight, already offers sufficient performance without the need for\nadditional asynchronous operations.\nProblem\nThe asynchronous approach to persistence introduces the following issues:\n\nIncreased complexity: Asynchronous operations, while designed to improve\nperformance, add complexity to the system, making it harder to reason about\nand troubleshoot.\nRace conditions and edge cases: The asynchronous operations have led to\npotential race conditions, which compromise the system’s reliability.\nDebugging difficulty: To avoid the race conditions above, we could have\nuse abstractions, including Go channels. However, using Go channels and\nasynchronous operations creates challenges for debugging, as tracking state\ntransitions becomes non-trivial.\n\nGiven that SQLite is already fast enough for our needs, the performance benefit\nof using asynchronous operations is minimal. As a result, we no longer see a\nsignificant justification for using asynchronous persistence operations in\nthis context.\nDecision\n\n\nSynchronous Persistence: All database persistence operations will now be\nsynchronous.\n\nJustification: Since SQLite is sufficiently fast, and we are not seeing\nperformance bottlenecks at the database level, the simplicity of synchronous\noperations outweighs the potential complexity of maintaining asynchronous\nones.\nExpected Outcome: This decision reduces the complexity of the codebase,\neliminates the potential for race conditions, and makes the system easier\nto debug and maintain. We will continue to monitor for any performance\nimpact that might arise due to this decision.\n\n\n\nFallback to Async if Performance Issues Arise: In the unlikely event that\nwe observe significant performance issues with synchronous operations, we\nwill consider optimizing specific areas locally.\n\nOptimization Strategy: If performance degradation is observed, we will\nexplore optimization options such as local caching, batching of persistence\noperations, or fine-tuning SQLite settings. Asynchronous operations may be\nreintroduced selectively in these cases.\n\n\n\nConsequences\n\nReduced Complexity: By removing asynchronous operations, the system will\nbe simpler and easier to maintain, with fewer edge cases and race conditions\nto handle.\nPerformance Tradeoff: Synchronous operations may result in slight\nperformance degradation if there is a heavy load on the persistence layer.\nHowever, this is unlikely given the current design and SQLite’s speed.\nEasier Debugging: The synchronous model simplifies debugging, as there are\nno concurrent operations that need to be tracked.\n\nAlternatives Considered\n\nAsync Persistence: We initially considered keeping asynchronous operations\nto prevent blocking and improve performance. However, this would introduce\ncomplexity that isn’t justified by the system’s current requirements and\nSQLite’s speed.\nGo Channels for Sync Operations: Using Go channels to handle\nsynchronization in asynchronous operations was also considered, but it would\nincrease debugging complexity and not address the core issue effectively.\n\n\nThis ADR will be revisited if performance issues arise, but for now, the shift\nto synchronous persistence aligns with the goal of simplifying the codebase and\nimproving system stability.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/architecture/adrs/adr-0017/","title":"ADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence for SPIKE Secrets Store"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/architecture/architectural-decision-records/":{"body":"\n\nSPIKE Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)\n\nADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence for SPIKE Secrets Store\nADR-0016: Memory-First Secrets Store\nADR-0015: Use Singular Form for File and Package Naming\nADR-0014: Maintaining SQLite as SPIKE’s Primary Storage Backend\nADR-0013: S3-Compatible Storage as SPIKE’s Backing Store\nADR-0012: HTTP Methods for SPIKE API\nADR-0011: PostgreSQL as SPIKE’s Backing Store\nADR-0010: Session Token Storage Strategy for SPIKE Nexus\nADR-0009: Multi-Administrator Support System\nADR-0008: Administrative Access Control System\nADR-0007: Root Key Lifecycle and Management Strategy\nADR-0006: Trust Boundary Definition and Security Assumptions\nADR-0005: Use SPIFFE mTLS for Inter-Component Authentication and Communication\nADR-0004: SPIKE Keeper Minimalist Design Approach\nADR-0003: Root Key Management and Storage Strategy\nADR-0002: Use Docsify for Documentation System\nADR-0001: Display Secrets in Plain Text in SPIKE Pilot Admin CLI\n\n\n\nSPIKE System Overview\nSPIKE Security Model\nSPIKE Architectural Decision Records\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/architecture/architectural-decision-records/","title":"Architectural Decision Records"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/architecture/security-model/":{"body":"\nSPIKE Security Model\nsecurity model comes here.\n\n\nSPIKE System Overview\nSPIKE Security Model\nSPIKE Architectural Decision Records\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/architecture/security-model/","title":"Security Model"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/architecture/system-overview/":{"body":"\nSPIKE System Overview\nThis document provides an overview of SPIKE, a SPIFFE-native\nSecrets Management solution.

We recommend 5 SPIKE Keeper instances with a\nshard-generation threshold of 3, for production deployments.\n\n\nSPIKE Pilot\n\nIt is the CLI to the system.\nIt converts CLI commands to RESTful mTLS API calls to SPIKE Nexus.\nIt is the only management entry point to the system.\nDeleting/disabling/removing SPIKE Pilot reduces the attack surface\nof the system since admin operations will not be possible without\nSPIKE Pilot.\nSimilarly, revoking the SPIRE Server registration of SPIKE Pilot’s\nSVID will effectively block administrative access to the system,\nimproving the overall security posture.\n\n\n\n\nSPIKE System Overview\nSPIKE Security Model\nSPIKE Architectural Decision Records\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/architecture/system-overview/","title":"System Overview"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/community/":{"body":"\nCommunity\n\nHello Universe\nContact Us\nPresentations and Demos\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/community/","title":"Community"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/community/contact/":{"body":"\nGet in Touch\nHi 👋 —Thank you for wanting to contact us ❤️.\nThis page outlines the various ways you can touch base.\nSPIFFE Slack Workspace\nThe SPIFFE Slack Workspace if one of the best\nways to get in touch with the community.\nYou can use the SPIFFE Slack Workspace ask\nquestions, get help, and share ideas, comments, and suggestions with the\ncommunity.\nIf you have a question, issue with your development environment, a feature\nrequest, or a bug report, it’ll be great if you could initiate the\ndiscussion on Slack.\nEmail\nYou can also reach out to us on via email, sending an email to\nteam@spike.ist.\nGitHub Issues\nAdditionally, you can create a GitHub\nissue; however, we recommend\nusing the SPIFFE Slack, or\nsending an email to the team to initiate a discussion\nbefore creating an issue.\n\n\nHello Universe\nContact Us\nPresentations and Demos\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/community/contact/","title":"Contact Us"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/community/hello/":{"body":"\nCommunity\n👋 Welcome to the SPIKE community!

It is recommended to have\nadministrative privileges on your system, as some steps might require them.\nThe tools and resources mentioned in this guide are essential for building and\nworking with SPIKE effectively.\nMake sure to follow each step carefully to ensure a smooth experience. In case\nyou encounter issues, please discuss them on the SPIFFE community Slack.\nPrerequisites\nThis quickstart guide assumes you are using an Ubuntu Linux operating\nsystem. The steps may slightly differ if you are using a different operating\nsystem.\nHere’s the OS details that we are testing this guide on:\n\nIn addition, you will need the usual suspects:\n\ngit\nmake\ngo (the most recent version would do)\nnode (at least GitHub Copilot requires it on Linux)\nbuild-essential\n(i.e., sudo apt install build-essential)\n\nGo Environment Setup\nHere’s part of the go env setting we use for this guide. Yours might slightly\nvary depending on your development configuration.\nThe environment setup shown below is mostly what Go uses by default, yet, we\nprovide them just-in-case to eliminate any environment-related setup issues you\nmight face.\n\nIf needed, you can also use Go’s built-in tooling to view and modify your Go\nenvironment  settings.\nUse the go env command to inspect or set specific environment variables.\nFor example:\n\nThese changes made using the go env -w command are persistent and stored in\nGo configuration files. You can view these changes in the file located at\n$(go env GOENV). To reset a variable to its default value, use:\n\nBuilding SPIRE\nTo get started let’s create a development version of SPIRE. Note that this is\nnot a production-ready setup.

To resolve this name to the loopback address, add the following entry\nto your /etc/hosts file:\n\nSPIKE Starter Script\nThere is a starter script that combines and automates some of the steps in the\nfollowing sections. It configures and runs SPIRE Server, SPIRE Agent,\nSPIKE Nexus, and SPIKE Keeper.\nYou can run this to start all the required components:\n\nAnd then, on a separate terminal, you can run spike:\n\nAlthough the ./hack/start.sh script is convenient, it might be useful\nto run the components individually to understand the process better and\ndebug any issues that might arise.\nThe following sections will guide you through the individual steps.\n\nCLI Reference\nSince the SPIKE CLI is a work in progress an highly in flux, the best\nway to get the most up-to-date information is to run spike --help or\nspike [command] --help to learn about the available commands and flags.\nIn addition, you can check out the demo recordings to see the CLI in\naction.\n\nStart SPIRE Server\nStart the SPIRE Server:\n\nCreating Registration Entries\nThe following script will create registration entries for the SPIKE components:\n\nStart SPIRE Agent\nStart the SPIRE Agent:\n\nStart SPIKE Components\nThen start SPIKE components:\nMake sure you started the following binaries each run on a specific terminal\nwindow.\nStart the workloads:\n\nUsing SPIKE Pilot\nDefine an alias to SPIKE Pilot:\n\nRun SPIKE Pilot and explore the CLI:\n\nTesting Out SPIKE\nLet test SPIKE by creating a secret\n\nThat’s about it.\nEnjoy.\n\n\nSPIKE Quickstart Guide\nAlpha Release Notice\nConfiguring SPIKE\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/getting-started/guide/","title":"Quickstart"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/operations/":{"body":"\nOperations\n\nSPIKE Cross-Platform Build\nSPIKE Production Setup\nSPIKE Recovery Procedures\nSPIKE Release Management\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/operations/","title":"Operations"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/operations/build/":{"body":"\na\nsd\n\n\nSPIKE Cross-Platform Build\nSPIKE Production Setup\nSPIKE Recovery Procedures\nSPIKE Release Management\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/operations/build/","title":"SPIKE Cross-Platform Build"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/operations/production/":{"body":"\nasd\nfsa\n\n\nSPIKE Cross-Platform Build\nSPIKE Production Setup\nSPIKE Recovery Procedures\nSPIKE Release Management\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/operations/production/","title":"SPIKE Production Setup"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/operations/recovery/":{"body":"\nSPIKE Recovery Procedures\nTODO: SPIKE can autorecover if setup properly but sometimes you’ll need doomsday recovery.\n// TODO: this needs update.\nSPIKE Nexus Crash Recovery\n\nSPIKE Nexus crashes.\nNew SPIKE Nexus instance starts.\nSPIKE Nexus authenticates to SPIKE Keeper using SPIFFE\nmTLS.\nSPIKE Keeper provides the root key over mTLS.\nSPIKE Nexus resumes normal operation.\n\nComplete System Recovery\n\nBoth SPIKE Nexus, SPIKE Keeper are unavailable, or the system is\nin on other irrecoverable state.\nAdmin executes spike recover.\nAdmin provides their password.\nThe encrypted root key is fetched from the database and injected to\nthe memory of SPIKE Nexus.\nSPIKE Nexus syncs the root key with SPIKE Keeper.\nThe system resumes normal operation.\n\nSystem Reset\n\nBoth SPIKE Nexus and all SPIKE Keeper instances have crashed, there\nis no way to fetch the root key from SPIKE Keeper(s).\nAdmin has lost access to their password.\nThere is no backup administrator that could have avoided the “bus factor”.\nNo one is using a password management software so that this would have been\na non-issue from day zero.\nEveryone have learned their lessons, and now it’s time to reset the system\nand conduct an extensive “what went wrong / what should have been done” analysis.\nAn administrator with adequate privileges manually runs a reset shell script.\nSPIKE is reset to its factory defaults.\nA new admin user initializes SPIKE with a new secure password.\nAll former secrets are lost.\nAll former policies and configuration is lost.\nThis is a complete system reset.\n\nData Consistency\n\nIf the root key changes during recovery, the old encrypted data becomes\ninvalid.\nThe root key is backed up in the backing store (Postgres); however\nsecurely backing up the backing store is also crucial.\nThe root key cannot be recovered without the admin password.
