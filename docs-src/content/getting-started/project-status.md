# Early Access Release Notice

**SPIKE** is now available in an *Early Access* phase. While it's functionally 
stable and ready for deeper experimentation and feedback, it's not yet 
recommended for production environments. Features may still evolve, and some 
interfaces could change as we refine the project.

We invite developers and early adopters to explore, test, and contribute. Your 
input is invaluable in helping us shape a robust and reliable product.

Use in critical systems is not advised at this time.

üêª Thanks for your patience and support. We welcome your thoughts at
[team@spike.ist](mailto:team@spike.ist), and we'll announce broader availability 
as the project matures.
