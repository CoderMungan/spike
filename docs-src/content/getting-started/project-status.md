# Project Maturity: Development  [![Development Phase](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/.img/maturity/dev.svg)]

SPIKE is a SPIFFE-affiliated project that has reached **Development** maturity 
as defined in the [SPIFFE Project Lifecycle][lifecycle]. This means:

* **SPIKE** is functionally stable and suitable for broader experimentation and 
  community involvement.
* **SPIKE** is not yet production-ready, and certain features or interfaces may 
  continue to evolve.
* Stability and polish are improving, but users should expect occasional bugs or 
  breaking changes.

We invite developers and early adopters to explore, test, and contribute. Your
input is invaluable in helping us shape a robust and reliable product.

Use in critical systems is not advised at this time.

üêª Thanks for your patience and support. We welcome your thoughts at
üì¨ [team@spike.ist](mailto:team@spike.ist), and we'll announce when the project
is ready for production adoption.
