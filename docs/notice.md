## 🚨 Alpha Release Notice 🚨

* **Project Status**: **Alpha**

This project is currently in the Alpha stage. It's functional and available for
experimentation, but it's **NOT** yet ready for production use: You may 
encounter bugs, incomplete features, or breaking changes as the project evolves.

Use this project at your own risk if you're experimenting or contributing to its
development. For production-level stability, please wait for a more stable 
release.

Please note that the **SPIKE** documentation (*this website*) is a work in
progress too. It might be incomplete or inaccurate at times, and what the 
document states may not fully reflect how the code or the product behaves.

Please 🐻 with us for now, and send your feedback to
[team@spike.ist](mailto:team@spike.ist).

We will let you know through various channels when the project reaches adequate
maturity for public adoption.
