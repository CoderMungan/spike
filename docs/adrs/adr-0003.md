# ADR-0003: Root Key Management and Storage Strategy

## Context
We need a secure strategy for managing the root key that **SPIKE Nexus**
uses. This key is critical for the system's security and requires:

- Secure storage
- High availability
- Disaster recovery capabilities
- Protection against unauthorized access
- Balance between security and operational needs

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered approach for root key management:

1. Runtime Storage:
  - Root key will be stored in memory only as plain text
  - This applies to both SPIKE Nexus and SPIKE Keeper components

2. Persistent Storage:
  - Root key will be stored in PostgreSQL database
  - The stored version will be:
    - Salted
    - Encrypted
    - Protected by admin user's password

## Consequences

### Positive
- Enhanced security through memory-only plain text storage
- Reduced attack surface as plain text key never touches disk
- Recovery possible through encrypted backup in PostgreSQL
- Admin password dependency ensures authorized access only
- Salting provides protection against rainbow table attacks
- Separation of concerns between runtime and persistent storage

### Negative
- Memory-only storage means key is lost on service restart
- Dependency on admin user's password for recovery
- Need to manage salt generation and storage
- Potential performance impact from encryption/decryption operations
- Risk of key loss if both admin password and memory contents are lost
- Additional complexity in key recovery procedures

## Security Considerations
- Memory must be properly zeroed when key is no longer needed
- PostgreSQL access must be properly secured
- Admin password strength becomes critical for system security
- Salt management and storage must be handled securely
- Encryption algorithm and key derivation function must be carefully chosen

## Implementation Notes
1. Memory Storage:
  - Implement secure memory handling
  - Use secure string implementations where available

2. PostgreSQL Storage:
  - Use strong encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256)
  - Implement secure key derivation from admin password
  - Ensure proper salt generation and storage
