# ADR-0002: Use Docsify for Documentation System

## Context

We need a documentation system that:
- 
- Integrates well with our Git workflow
- Supports Markdown formatting
- Requires minimal setup and maintenance effort
- Is easy for developers to contribute to
- Can serve documentation directly from source control

## Decision

We will use **Docsify** as our documentation system.

## Consequences

### Positive
- 
- Git-native: Documentation lives directly in the repository as Markdown files
- Zero build process: Docsify generates documentation on the fly
- Markdown support: Developers can write documentation in familiar Markdown syntax
- Minimal setup: Only requires a single HTML file and basic configuration
- No static html files: Documentation is generated on-demand from Markdown
- Easy to maintain: No separate build pipeline or compilation step needed
- Good search capabilities out of the box
- Support for plugins and themes

### Negative

- Requires JavaScript to be enabled in the browser
- No static HTML generation means reduced SEO capabilities
- Documentation loading might be slightly slower compared to pre-built static sites
- Limited compared to full-featured documentation systems like MkDocs or Sphinx
