## Hardening SPIKE Keeper for Production

**SPIKE Keeper**s play a critical role in managing sensitive cryptographic 
material, specifically handling **shards** that are use to generate the
**root key** that **SPIKE Nexus** uses to encrypt its backing store.

**SPIKE Keeper**s only temporarily generate the root key during their
bootstrapping process, and securely erase it from the memory as soon as it
is no longer needed. Therefore, the possible window of attack for obtaining
the root key is extremely slim.

// TODO: add that, to get the root key you need privileged access on the 
machine or mitm the mTLS.

In addition, **SPIKE Keeper**s are protected by multiple layers of security:

1. **mTLS API Protection**: All **SPIKE Keeper** APIs are protected by mutual 
   TLS (mTLS), preventing direct access to the shards through the API interface.
2. **SPIFFE Attestation**: **SPIKE Keeper**s implement **SPIFFE attestation** 
   which verifies the authenticity of **SPIKE Keeper** binaries by validating 
  attributes like the SHA hash, unix user id, and path. This prevents attackers 
  from running malicious keeper processes, as they would fail the attestation 
  check.
3. **Memory Access Restrictions**: The only theoretical way to access the root 
  key is through direct memory access, which is heavily restricted by OS-level 
  security controls when properly configured.

Although these protections are in place, they need to be properly configured to
take effect. For example, a misconfigured SPIRE Server registration entry or
using a user with elevated privileges to run the **SPIKE Keeper** binaries may
result in a security breach.

## User Privileges

* Run **SPIKE Nexus** and **SPIKE Keeper** processes as **non-root** users.
* Configure them to have minimal permissions.
* Keep OS and security packages up-to-date.

## Security Modules

## Conclusion

Although **SPIKE** is designed security best-practices in mind, a multi-layer
approach focusing on system, process, and network security is important when
configuring **SPIKE** for production.

 The combination of **mTLS API protection**, **SPIFFE attestation**, and proper 
 **system-level security controls** will provide robust protection against
 unauthorized access to sensitive cryptographic material.

Remember that **security is an ongoing process**, and every system's security 
posture and requirements is different. Thus, these measures outlined in this
guide shall be taken as starting recommendations and adjusted to meet your
organization's security requirements.

## Root Key Security

In SPIKE, the root key is essential for encrypting secrets within the central store, SPIKE Nexus. To prevent any single entity from having full access to this key, SPIKE uses Shamir's Secret Sharing to divide the root key into multiple shares. These shares are distributed among SPIKE Keepers, ensuring that the root key can only be reconstructed when a sufficient number of shares are combined. This approach enhances security by requiring collaboration among multiple trusted components to access the root key.  
  Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS): SSS is a cryptographic method that divides a secret into parts, distributing them among participants. The secret can only be reconstructed when a minimum number of parts (the threshold) are combined. This ensures that partial knowledge of the secret does not compromise its security.   
  WIKIPEDIA  
  SPIKE Architecture: The article provides an overview of SPIKE's architecture, detailing the roles of SPIKE Keepers and SPIKE Nexus. It explains the workflows involved in initializing the system, generating and distributing key shares, and reconstructing the root key when necessary. The integration with SPIFFE ensures secure communication between components through mutual TLS (mTLS).  
  Security Measures: Beyond SSS, SPIKE incorporates multiple layers of security, including SPIFFE-based mTLS encryption for communication, in-memory storage of the root key to prevent disk exposure, and strict access controls. The system is designed to resist various attack vectors, ensuring that even if individual components are compromised, the root key remains protected.  
  Disaster Recovery Considerations: The article touches on strategies for disaster recovery, emphasizing the importance of deploying multiple SPIKE Keepers, potentially across different geographic locations, to ensure that the root key can be reconstructed even if some Keepers fail. It also hints at future enhancements involving multi-party approval processes for key reconstruction.  
  Overall, the article illustrates how SPIKE leverages Shamir's Secret Sharing, in conjunction with SPIFFE and other security measures, to create a robust and secure secrets management system suitable for modern distributed infrastructures.

  Okay; in the flow keepers temporarily compute a root key and then send shards.
- what if the flow was inverted?
- That is, nexus computed a root key, computed shards, sent shards to keepers and then initialized the db backend and discarded the root key. — how would the threat model change, if at all? — what would be the new benefits and liabilities of this situation?
  ChatGPT said:
- ChatGPT
  Inverting the key generation flow in SPIKE—having the Nexus generate the root key, compute the shares, distribute them to the Keepers, initialize the database backend, and then discard the root key—alters the threat model and introduces new benefits and liabilities.  
  Current Flow:  
  Process: Keepers collaboratively generate the root key, compute shares, and provide them to the Nexus.  
  Security Implications: This decentralized approach ensures no single entity has complete control over the root key, aligning with zero-trust principles and reducing the risk of insider threats.  
  Inverted Flow:  
  Process: Nexus generates the root key, computes shares, distributes them to Keepers, initializes the database backend, and then discards the root key.  
  Benefits:  
  Simplified Key Management: Centralizing key generation can streamline the process, potentially reducing complexity in coordinating multiple Keepers.  
  Consistent Initialization: Ensures a uniform starting point for all Keepers, as the Nexus controls the initial key generation and distribution.  
  Liabilities:  
  Single Point of Failure: The Nexus becomes a critical point during key generation. If compromised during this phase, the entire system's security could be at risk.  
  Increased Attack Surface: Centralizing key generation may attract adversaries to target the Nexus during initialization, seeking to intercept or influence the root key before it's discarded.  
  Deviation from Zero-Trust Principles: This approach concentrates trust in the Nexus during key generation, potentially conflicting with zero-trust architectures that advocate for distributed trust.  
  Threat Model Changes:  
  Insider Threats: With the Nexus generating the root key, any compromise of the Nexus during initialization could expose the entire system to risk.  
  External Attacks: Attackers may focus efforts on the Nexus during the key generation phase, knowing it temporarily holds the complete root key.  
  Mitigation Strategies:  
  Enhanced Security Measures: Implement robust security protocols during the Nexus's key generation phase, such as strict access controls, monitoring, and ephemeral environments that are destroyed post-initialization.  
  Distributed Key Generation (DKG): Consider employing DKG protocols that allow multiple parties to jointly generate a key without any single party knowing the complete key, maintaining a decentralized trust model.  
  Conclusion:  
  Inverting the key generation flow centralizes the process, offering potential simplifications but introducing significant security risks by creating a temporary single point of failure. Aligning with zero-trust principles and maintaining a distributed approach to key generation, as in the current SPIKE architecture, provides a more robust security posture.  
  Key Takeaways:  
  Centralizing key generation simplifies processes but introduces a single point of failure.  
  Distributed key generation aligns better with zero-trust principles, enhancing security.  
  Mitigation strategies are essential if centralization is pursued, though they may add complexity.

  You said:  
  wouldn't those attacks be possible on keepers too.  
  I mean, keeper temporarily creates the root key. so an attacker can access the keeper, reboot it (which, then (as per the video on the article) will trigger the keeper to ask shards from its peers and recompute the root key. -- at that point the attacker can get the key.  
  So it's securing one nexus, versus securing many keepers -- isn't it?  
  ChatGPT said:
- ChatGPT
  You're correct in observing that both the current and inverted key generation flows in SPIKE present potential attack vectors during the temporary computation of the root key. Let's delve deeper into the security implications of each approach.  
  Current Flow: Keeper-Initiated Key Generation  
  Process: Keepers collaboratively generate the root key, compute shares, and provide them to the Nexus.  
  Potential Attack Vector: An attacker compromising a Keeper could trigger a reboot, prompting the Keeper to request shares from its peers to recompute the root key. During this recomputation, the attacker might access the root key.  
  Mitigation: Securing multiple Keepers involves implementing robust security measures across all Keeper nodes, such as intrusion detection systems, regular audits, and stringent access controls. The distributed nature means that compromising a single Keeper is insufficient; an attacker would need to compromise multiple Keepers to reconstruct the root key, aligning with zero-trust principles.  
  Inverted Flow: Nexus-Initiated Key Generation  
  Process: The Nexus generates the root key, computes shares, distributes them to Keepers, initializes the database backend, and then discards the root key.  
  Potential Attack Vector: An attacker compromising the Nexus during the key generation phase could access the root key before it's discarded.  
  Mitigation: Securing the Nexus during this critical phase requires implementing enhanced security protocols, such as ephemeral environments, strict access controls, and continuous monitoring. However, this centralization introduces a single point of failure during the key generation process.  
  Comparative Analysis  
  Attack Surface: The current flow distributes the attack surface across multiple Keepers, requiring an attacker to compromise several nodes to access the root key. In contrast, the inverted flow centralizes the attack surface to the Nexus during key generation, making it a more attractive target during that phase.  
  Single Point of Failure: The inverted flow introduces a single point of failure during key generation, as the Nexus holds the complete root key temporarily. The current flow mitigates this by ensuring no single entity ever holds the entire root key independently.  
  Alignment with Zero-Trust Principles: The current flow's distributed approach aligns with zero-trust principles by minimizing trust in any single component. The inverted flow's temporary centralization deviates from these principles during key generation.  
  Conclusion  
  While both approaches have inherent risks during the temporary computation of the root key, the current Keeper-initiated flow offers a more robust security posture by distributing trust and reducing the risk associated with a single point of failure. Implementing comprehensive security measures across all Keepers is essential to mitigate potential attacks.  
  Key Takeaways:  
  Both flows have potential vulnerabilities during root key computation.  
  The current distributed approach reduces the risk of a single point of failure.  
  Comprehensive security measures are crucial for all components involved.

- Not quite.
    1. root into keeper
    2. restart keeper process
    3. attach to the memory of keeper
    4. keeper computes three shards (and the root key)
    5. either grab the root key, or the shards and recreate the root key
    6. if (5) fails, start from (1)  
       So I have a feeling the attack surface is increased, instead of spreading the risk -- at least during bootstrapping.  
       ChatGPT said:

  Your analysis highlights a critical aspect of the SPIKE system's security during the bootstrapping phase. An attacker with sufficient access to a single Keeper could potentially exploit the key reconstruction process to extract the root key. This scenario underscores that, during bootstrapping, the attack surface may indeed be broader, as each Keeper's initialization process becomes a potential vulnerability.  
  Key Considerations:  
  Bootstrapping Vulnerability: During initialization, each Keeper engages in processes that could be susceptible to exploitation if an attacker gains sufficient access. This period is particularly sensitive, as the system's defenses may not yet be fully operational.  
  Operational Security Measures: Once the system is fully operational, standard security protocols, such as mutual TLS (mTLS) encryption for communication and in-memory storage of the root key, provide robust protection. However, the bootstrapping phase requires additional safeguards to mitigate the risks you've identified.  
  Mitigation Strategies:  
  Enhanced Bootstrapping Security: Implement stringent security measures during the initialization phase, including access controls, monitoring, and possibly delaying the exposure of critical operations until the system is fully secured.  
  Secure Initialization Procedures: Develop protocols that minimize the exposure of sensitive processes during bootstrapping, such as delaying key reconstruction until a secure environment is confirmed.  
  Comprehensive Threat Modeling: Conduct thorough analyses to identify and address potential vulnerabilities specific to the bootstrapping phase, ensuring that all aspects of the system's lifecycle are secured.  
  Conclusion:  
  Your insights are invaluable in highlighting the need for a holistic approach to security that encompasses all operational phases, including bootstrapping. By implementing targeted measures during initialization, the SPIKE system can achieve a more comprehensive security posture, effectively mitigating the risks associated with the scenarios you've described.  
  Key Takeaways:  
  Bootstrapping Phases Are Critical: Special attention is required during system initialization to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  
  Implement Targeted Security Measures: Adopt specific strategies to secure the system during all operational phases, including bootstrapping.  
  Holistic Security Approach: Ensure that security protocols address vulnerabilities across the entire system lifecycle.

  in that case wouldn't it be better to do all those hardening on Nexus (which we need to do anyway since it stores secrets and other sensitive data) rather than securing n-many keepers?
- It is less operational complexity (i.e. inverting the flow).
  ChatGPT said:
- ChatGPT
  Your proposal to centralize key generation within the Nexus, thereby reducing the operational complexity associated with securing multiple Keepers, is a valid consideration. This approach could streamline operations by focusing hardening efforts on a single component. However, it's essential to weigh this operational simplicity against potential security implications.  
  Benefits of Centralizing Key Generation in Nexus:  
  Reduced Operational Complexity: Concentrating security measures on the Nexus simplifies the overall security architecture, potentially lowering the administrative overhead associated with managing multiple Keepers.  
  Focused Hardening Efforts: With the Nexus as the central point for key generation and management, resources can be allocated more efficiently to implement robust security controls, monitoring, and defenses on this single component.  
  Potential Liabilities:  
  Single Point of Failure: Centralizing key generation in the Nexus introduces a critical dependency. If the Nexus is compromised during key generation, the entire system's security could be at risk.  
  Deviation from Zero-Trust Principles: Zero-trust architectures advocate for distributed trust to minimize risks. Centralizing key generation may conflict with these principles by placing significant trust in a single component.  
  Mitigation Strategies:  
  Enhanced Security Measures: Implement comprehensive security protocols for the Nexus, including strict access controls, continuous monitoring, and regular security audits, to mitigate the risks associated with centralization.  
  Redundancy and Backup Plans: Establish robust backup and disaster recovery procedures to address potential failures or compromises of the Nexus.  
  Conclusion:  
  While centralizing key generation within the Nexus can reduce operational complexity, it's crucial to balance this with the potential security risks introduced by creating a single point of failure. A thorough risk assessment and the implementation of robust security measures are essential to ensure that this architectural change does not compromise the system's overall security posture.  
  Key Takeaways:  
  Operational Simplicity vs. Security Risks: Centralization simplifies operations but may introduce new security challenges.  
  Need for Robust Security Measures: If centralizing, ensure the Nexus is fortified with comprehensive security controls to mitigate associated risks.  
  Alignment with Security Principles: Consider how this approach aligns with or deviates from established security frameworks, such as zero-trust architectures.

  If I am root on the machine, most of these defenses are gone I guess, no?  
  ChatGPT said:
- ChatGPT
  You're correct; the root user in Linux possesses unrestricted access to the system, including the ability to override most security measures. This level of access means that if an attacker gains root privileges, they can potentially bypass or disable defenses designed to protect sensitive processes and data.  
  Implications of Root Access:  
  Unrestricted System Control: The root user can read, modify, or delete any file, change system configurations, and control all processes.  
  Bypassing Security Measures: With root access, an attacker can disable security modules, alter permissions, and access protected memory spaces, effectively nullifying implemented security measures.  
  Mitigation Strategies:  
  Minimize Root Usage:  
  Implementation: Avoid using the root account for routine operations. Instead, perform administrative tasks using a regular user account with elevated privileges through sudo. This practice limits the exposure of the root account and reduces the risk of accidental or malicious system-wide changes.  
  Benefit: Decreases the likelihood of unauthorized root access and potential system compromise.  
  Disable Root Login Over SSH:  
  Implementation: Prevent direct root login via SSH by editing the SSH daemon configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) and setting PermitRootLogin no. After making this change, restart the SSH service to apply the new configuration.   
  UMATECHNOLOGY  
  Benefit: Reduces the attack surface by requiring users to log in with a non-root account and then escalate privileges, making unauthorized root access more difficult.  
  Implement Principle of Least Privilege:  
  Implementation: Assign users and processes only the minimum privileges necessary to perform their functions. Regularly audit user accounts and permissions to ensure compliance with this principle.  
  Benefit: Limits the potential damage from compromised accounts by restricting access to only necessary resources.  
  Regular Security Audits and Monitoring:  
  Implementation: Conduct periodic security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security policies. Implement monitoring tools to detect suspicious activities, such as unauthorized privilege escalations or access attempts.  
  Benefit: Enables early detection and response to potential security incidents, mitigating the impact of unauthorized access.  
  Keep Systems Updated:  
  Implementation: Regularly apply security patches and updates to the operating system and installed software to address known vulnerabilities that could be exploited for privilege escalation.  
  Benefit: Reduces the risk of exploitation through known vulnerabilities, enhancing overall system security.  
  Conclusion:  
  While the root user inherently has the capability to bypass most security measures, implementing strict access controls, minimizing root usage, and adhering to the principle of least privilege can significantly enhance system security. Regular audits and updates further ensure that potential vulnerabilities are addressed promptly, maintaining the integrity of your Linux environment.  
  Key Takeaways:  
  Limit the use of the root account to essential administrative tasks only.  
  Disable direct root login over SSH to prevent unauthorized remote access.  
  Apply the principle of least privilege to restrict user and process permissions.  
  Regularly audit and monitor system activities to detect and respond to potential security threats.  
  Keep the system and software up to date with the latest security patches.

  And if I'm not root, I cannot likely attach a debugger to the process to watch its memory. correct?  
  ChatGPT said:
- ChatGPT
  You're correct; without root privileges, attaching a debugger like GDB to a running process is generally restricted due to security measures in Linux systems. By default, the Linux kernel's Yama security module enforces a policy that prevents non-root users from attaching debuggers to processes they do not own. This is controlled by the /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope setting.  
  Understanding ptrace_scope Levels:  
  The ptrace_scope setting determines the level of restriction for the ptrace system call, which debuggers use to attach to processes:  
  0: No restrictions; any process can be traced by any user.  
  1: (Default) A process can only be traced by its parent or by processes with the appropriate permissions.  
  2: Only processes with the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability can use ptrace to trace other processes.  
  3: No processes may be traced; ptrace is effectively disabled.  
  Modifying ptrace_scope Temporarily:  
  To allow a non-root user to attach a debugger to a process they own, you can temporarily modify the ptrace_scope setting:  
  echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope  
  This command sets ptrace_scope to 0, reducing restrictions. However, this change is temporary and will revert upon reboot.

  Permanently Modifying ptrace_scope:  
  To make this change persistent across reboots, add the following line to a sysctl configuration file, such as /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf:  
  kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0  
  Then, apply the changes with:  
  sudo sysctl --system  
  Granting CAP_SYS_PTRACE Capability to GDB:  
  Alternatively, you can grant the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability to the GDB executable, allowing it to attach to processes without requiring root privileges:  
  sudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace=eip /usr/bin/gdb  
  This command assigns the necessary capability to GDB. Note that modifying capabilities can have security implications, so proceed with caution.   
  GITHUB  
  Security Considerations:  
  Altering ptrace_scope or granting capabilities can expose the system to potential security risks. It's essential to understand the implications and ensure that only trusted users have access to debugging tools.  
  Conclusion:  
  While non-root users are generally restricted from attaching debuggers to running processes due to security policies, these restrictions can be adjusted by modifying system settings or granting specific capabilities. However, such changes should be made with caution, considering the security implications for your system.  
  Key Takeaways:  
  By default, Linux restricts non-root users from attaching debuggers to processes they do not own.  
  Modifying the ptrace_scope setting can adjust these restrictions, either temporarily or permanently.  
  Granting the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability to GDB allows non-root users to attach it to processes.  
  Always consider the security implications before making such changes.

  Running the keeper process as a non-root user enhances security by limiting the potential impact of a compromised process. In Linux, processes are generally restricted from accessing the memory of other processes unless they have the necessary permissions. This isolation is enforced by the operating system to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.  
  Key Points:  
  Process Isolation: Linux enforces process isolation, preventing non-privileged users from accessing the memory of processes they do not own. This means that, under normal circumstances, an attacker without root privileges cannot directly access the memory of the keeper process to extract sensitive information like the root key.  
  ptrace Restrictions: The ptrace system call, commonly used by debuggers to inspect process memory, is restricted by default. Non-root users can typically only attach to processes they own, and even then, certain security modules like Yama can impose further restrictions. This adds an additional layer of protection against unauthorized memory access.  
  Considerations:  
  Secure Memory Management: While running keeper as a non-root user provides a level of security, it's crucial to implement secure memory management practices. This includes ensuring that sensitive data, such as the root key, is securely erased from memory immediately after use to prevent any potential leakage.  
  System Hardening: Beyond user privileges, consider additional system hardening measures, such as enabling security modules like AppArmor or SELinux, to enforce mandatory access controls and further isolate processes.  
  Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and monitoring to detect any unauthorized attempts to access process memory or escalate privileges. This proactive approach helps in maintaining the overall security posture of the system.  
  Conclusion:  
  Running the keeper process as a non-root user significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to its memory space, thereby protecting sensitive information like the root key. However, it's essential to complement this practice with secure memory management, system hardening, and regular security audits to ensure comprehensive protection.  
  Key Takeaways:  
  Non-root processes are generally isolated from each other's memory spaces, enhancing security.  
  Implementing secure memory management and system hardening measures further protects sensitive data.  
  Regular security audits are essential to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts.
