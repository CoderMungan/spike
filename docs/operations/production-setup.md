## Hardening SPIKE Keeper for Production

**SPIKE Keeper**s play a critical role in managing sensitive cryptographic 
material, specifically handling **shards** that are use to generate the
**root key** that **SPIKE Nexus** uses to encrypt its backing store.

**SPIKE Keeper**s only temporarily generate the root key during their
bootstrapping process, and securely erase it from the memory as soon as it
is no longer needed. Therefore, the possible window of attack for obtaining
the root key is extremely slim.

In addition, **SPIKE Keeper**s are protected by multiple layers of security:

1. **mTLS API Protection**: All **SPIKE Keeper** APIs are protected by mutual 
   TLS (mTLS), preventing direct access to the shards through the API interface.
2. **SPIFFE Attestation**: **SPIKE Keeper**s implement **SPIFFE attestation** 
   which verifies the authenticity of **SPIKE Keeper** binaries by validating 
  attributes like the SHA hash, unix user id, and path. This prevents attackers 
  from running malicious keeper processes, as they would fail the attestation 
  check.
3. **Memory Access Restrictions**: The only theoretical way to access the root 
  key is through direct memory access, which is heavily restricted by OS-level 
  security controls when properly configured.

Although these protections are in place, they need to be properly configured to
take effect. For example, a misconfigured SPIRE Server registration entry or
using a user with elevated privileges to run the **SPIKE Keeper** binaries may
result in a security breach.

## User Privileges

* Run **SPIKE Nexus** and **SPIKE Keeper** processes as **non-root** users.
* Configure them to have minimal permissions.
* Keep OS and security packages up-to-date.

## Security Modules

* For Linux bare-metal **SPIKE** installations, enable and configure AppArmor
  and SELinux
* Set up mandatory access control.
* Enforce strict process isolation.

## Process Security

For process isolation follow these guidelines:

* Configure appropriate resource limits 
* Utilize Linux namespaces where applicable 
* Implement strict file descriptor controls 
* Set up process capability controls

## Network Security

* Restrict network access to essential ports/protocols 
* Implement network segmentation 
* Configure strict firewall rules 
* Regular network security audits

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Logging and Monitoring

* Set up comprehensive process logging
* Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
* Implement real-time alerting
* Regular log analysis and review

### Security Auditing

* Regular system configuration audits
* Security control effectiveness reviews
* Periodic penetration testing
* Configuration compliance checks

## Deployment Security

### Infrastructure as Code

* Version-controlled configuration management
* Automated security testing in CI/CD
* Secure configuration baselines
* Regular security assessments

### Binary Integrity

* Implement SHA hash verification
* Regular binary integrity checks
* Secure update procedures
* Version control and tracking

## Best Practices for Implementation

### Defense in Depth

* Implement multiple layers of security controls
* No single point of failure
* Regular security control reviews
* Comprehensive security documentation

### Continuous Improvement

* Regular security assessments
* Update security measures based on new threats
* Keep security documentation current
*Regular team security training

## Conclusion

Although **SPIKE** is designed security best-practices in mind, a multi-layer
approach focusing on system, process, and network security is important when
configuring **SPIKE** for production.

 The combination of **mTLS API protection**, **SPIFFE attestation**, and proper 
 **system-level security controls** will provide robust protection against
 unauthorized access to sensitive cryptographic material.

Remember that **security is an ongoing process**, and every system's security 
posture and requirements is different. Thus, these measures outlined in this
guide shall be taken as starting recommendations and adjusted to meet your
organization's security requirements.
