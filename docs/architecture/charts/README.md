## Flowcharts and Sequence Diagrams

> **Please Check the Source Code Too**
> 
> **SPIKE** is evolving really fast, and the documentation---especially
> the charts and diagrams---might be lagging behind the actual code.
> 
> Please [check out the source code](https://github.com/spiffe/spike) and
> [watch the demo recordings](https://spike.ist/#/presentations/README) to
> cross-check. When in doubt, source code is the true source of truth.
> 
> **this notice will be removed once we ensure all diagrams on this website
> is up to date**.
