## Secure Production Identity for Key Encryption (SPIKE)

**SPIKE**  is a lightweight **secrets store** that uses [SPIFFE][spiffe] 
as its identity control plane.

**SPIKE** protects your secrets and helps your ops, SREs, and sysadmins 
`#sleepmore`. 

* See the [**Architectural Design Document**][architecture] to learn more 
  about **SPIKE**, 
* or [**take a look at the quickstart guide**][quickstart] to get your hands 
  dirty.
