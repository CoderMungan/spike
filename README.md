## Secure Production Identity for Key Encryption (SPIKE)

**SPIKE** is a lightweight secrets store that uses [SPIFFE][spiffe]
as its identity control plane.

**SPIKE** protects your secrets and helps your ops, SREs, and sysadmins
`#sleepmore`.

For more information, [see the documentation][docs].

## The Elevator Pitch

[**SPIKE**][spike] is a streamlined, highly-reliable secrets store that leverages 
[SPIFFE][spiffe] framework for strong, production-grade identity control. 

Built with simplicity and high availability in mind, SPIKE empowers ops teams, 
SREs, and sysadmins to protect sensitive data and `#sleepmore` by securing 
secrets across distributed environments.

Key components include:

* **SPIKE Nexus**: The heart of SPIKE, handling secret encryption, decryption, 
  and root key management.
* **SPIKE Keeper**: A redundancy mechanism that safely holds root keys in memory, 
  enabling fast recovery if Nexus fails.
* **SPIKE Pilot**: A secure CLI interface, translating commands into **mTLS** 
  API calls, reducing system vulnerability by containing all admin access.

With its minimal footprint and robust security, **SPIKE** provides peace of mind 
for your team and critical data resilience when it counts.

## Early Access Release Notice

**SPIKE** is now available in an *Early Access* phase. While it's functionally
stable and ready for deeper experimentation and feedback, it's not yet
recommended for production environments. Features may still evolve, and some
interfaces could change as we refine the project.

We invite developers and early adopters to explore, test, and contribute. Your
input is invaluable in helping us shape a robust and reliable product.

Use in critical systems is not advised at this time.

üêª Thanks for your patience and support. We welcome your thoughts at
[team@spike.ist](mailto:team@spike.ist), and we'll announce broader availability
as the project matures.
