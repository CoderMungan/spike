## Secure Production Identity for Key Encryption (SPIKE)

**SPIKE** is a lightweight secrets store that uses [SPIFFE][spiffe]
as its identity control plane.

**SPIKE** protects your secrets and helps your ops, SREs, and sysadmins
`#sleepmore`.

For more information, [see the documentation][docs].

## The Elevator Pitch

[**SPIKE**][spike] is a streamlined, highly-reliable secrets store that leverages 
[SPIFFE][spiffe] framework for strong, production-grade identity control. 

Built with simplicity and high availability in mind, SPIKE empowers ops teams, 
SREs, and sysadmins to protect sensitive data and `#sleepmore` by securing 
secrets across distributed environments.

Key components include:

* **SPIKE Nexus**: The heart of SPIKE, handling secret encryption, decryption, 
  and root key management.
* **SPIKE Keeper**: A redundancy mechanism that safely holds root keys in memory, 
  enabling fast recovery if Nexus fails.
* **SPIKE Pilot**: A secure CLI interface, translating commands into **mTLS** 
  API calls, reducing system vulnerability by containing all admin access.

With its minimal footprint and robust security, **SPIKE** provides peace of mind 
for your team and critical data resilience when it counts.

## üö® Alpha Release Notice üö®

* **Project Status**: **Alpha**

This project is currently in the Alpha stage. It's functional and available for
experimentation, but it's **NOT** yet ready for production use: You may encounter
bugs, incomplete features, or breaking changes as the project evolves.

Use this project at your own risk if you're experimenting or contributing to its
development. For production-level stability, please wait for a more stable
release.

Please note that the [**SPIKE** documentation][docs] is a work in progress too.
It might be incomplete or inaccurate at times, and what the document
states may not fully reflect how the code or the product behaves.

Please üêª with us for now, and send your feedback to [team@spike.ist](mailto:team@spike.ist).

We will let you know through various channels when the project reaches adequate
maturity for public adoption.

## Getting Your Hands Dirty
