## üö® Alpha Release Notice üö®

* **Project Status**: **Alpha**

This project is currently in the Alpha stage. It's functional and available for
experimentation, but it's **NOT** yet ready for production use: You may encounter
bugs, incomplete features, or breaking changes as the project evolves.

Use this project at your own risk if you're experimenting or contributing to its
development. For production-level stability, please wait for a more stable release.

Please note that the [**SPIKE** documentation][docs] is a work in progress too. 
It might be incomplete or inaccurate at times, and what the document
states may not fully reflect how the code or the product behaves.

Please üêª with us for now, and send your feedback to
[team@spike.ist](mailto:team@spike.ist).

We will let you know through various channels when the project reaches adequate
maturity for public adoption.
